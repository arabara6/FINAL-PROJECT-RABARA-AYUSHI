        <h2>Female Reproductive System</h2>
        <p>The female reproductive system is one of the most vital parts of the human reproductive process. Although a man is needed to reproduce, it is the woman who incubates the developing fetus and delivers the child into the world.</p>
        <p>Females are born with a large number of potential ova (female sex cells, also called egg cells). However, it isn’t until after the onset of puberty, typically around age 12, that these cells are mature enough to sustain life. The cells ripen on a regular basis, but only one is released each month until a woman reaches menopause. Menopause commonly begins between the ages of 45 and 55.</p>
        <p>The major organs of the female reproductive system include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Vagina:</span> This muscular tube receives the penis during intercourse and through it a baby leaves the uterus during childbirth.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Uterus:</span> This organ holds and nourishes a developing fetus, if an egg was properly fertilized.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Ovaries:</span> The female gonads, the ovaries produce ova. When one matures, it is released down into a fallopian tube.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Fallopian tubes:</span> These small tubes transport ova from the ovaries to the uterus. This is where an egg waits to be fertilized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When properly fertilized with a man’s sperm — either through intercourse or artificial insemination — a woman’s egg carries all of the necessary material to produce children. While pregnant, a woman will go through several internal signs before the typical “baby belly” begins to show. These signs are the body’s reactions to the hormones generated during the fertilization process.</p>
        <p>As a fetus grows, a woman’s body will prepare for the birthing process, which includes the widening of the pubic symphysis, a joint between the two pubic bones. Vaginal birth is the most common form of delivery, but the use of cesarean section (removing the child through a surgical incision in the mother’s abdomen) is on the rise.</p>
        <p>Because carrying a child and giving birth is such a delicate process, numerous physical problems for the mother can arise. Common pregnancy complications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preeclampsia</li>
            <li>Urinary tract infection</li>
            <li>Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)</li>
            <li>Fetal growth restriction</li>
            <li>Ectopic pregnancy</li>
            <li>Premature birth</li>
            <li>Miscarriage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Male Reproductive System</h2>
        <p>Humans are sexual, meaning that both a male and a female are needed to reproduce. Each is equipped with specific organs capable of producing specific cells needed to procreate. In conjunction with a woman’s reproductive organs, sexual intercourse can lead to the reproduction of human life.</p>
        <p>For men, the external reproductive organs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Penis:</span> This tubular, muscular organ fills with blood during arousal, thus making sexual intercourse possible.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Scrotum:</span> This pouch-like sac hangs below the penis and encases the testes, or testicles.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Testicle:</span> These two oval shaped organs produce sperm cells and testosterone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While all men are born with all of their sexual organs, they don’t begin to function fully until puberty. The average age of puberty for males is around 12. During this time, hormone changes affect a boy’s gonads and create lasting changes that have typically been viewed through history as “when a boy becomes a man.” This process has many effects, such as growth in stature, muscular development, and hair growth on the genitals and face. In terms of reproduction, puberty signals the time when a man has fully-functioning sexual organs and is capable of fathering an offspring. </p>
        <p>The male testes produce spermatozoa (more commonly referred to as sperm), which are released at sexual climax, or orgasm. This is known as ejaculation. The sperm leaves the penis in a mixture of secretions designed to nourish and transport the cells into the female reproductive system for procreation. There are up to 750 million sperm cells contained in a single ejaculation, but it only takes one sperm cell to fertilize a woman’s egg.</p>
        <p>The testes also produce the hormone testosterone, which is directly absorbed into the bloodstream. Along with regulating sperm production and maintaining sexual function, testosterone also facilitates common features that physically distinguish men from women, such as facial hair, a deeper voice, more muscle mass, and broader shoulders; these are referred to as “secondary sex characteristics.”</p>
        <p>As a man ages, sexual function typically diminishes. Typical sexual abnormalities in men include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Impotence (erectile dysfunction)</li>
            <li>Sterility</li>
            <li>Low sperm count</li>
            <li>Lowered testosterone</li>
            <li>Premature ejaculation</li>
        </ul>
